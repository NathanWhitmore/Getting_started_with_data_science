### Objective
The purpose of this website is to provide brief, practical advice to people wanting to better integrate data science into their conservation projects. 

<br>

### Motivation
Currently, there is no stand-alone work which adequately explains the basic data and project management concepts that most conservation projects are faced with. 

While an adequate understanding can often be gained from years of practical experience or through a good understanding of scientific and management principles -- most conservation practitioners don't have the luxury of time. Hopefully, the tools and tricks contained in this website will accelerate the learning process.

<br>

### New material
This website is a work in progress. Once a month I plan to add a new chapter.

<br>

### If you want more...
If you want to go a step further and get into the nuts and bolts of data science with program R, a free and versatile statistical programming environment, you may like to check out my book: **R for Conservation and Development Projects: A Primer for Practitioners** which came out in 2021.

- [The Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/R-for-Conservation-Development-Projects-Nathan-Whitmore/9780367205485?ref=grid-view&qid=1611283102040&sr=1-1)

### About the book
This book is aimed at conservation and development practitioners who need to learn and use R in a part-time professional context. It gives people with a non-technical background a set of skills to graph, map, and model in R. It also provides background on data integration in project management and covers fundamental statistical concepts. The book aims to demystify R and give practitioners the confidence to use it.

<br>

**Key Features:**

* Viewing data science as part of a greater knowledge and decision making system
* Foundation sections on inference, evidence, and data integration
* Plain English explanations of R functions
* Relatable examples which are typical of activities undertaken by conservation and development organisations in the developing world
* Worked examples showing how data analysis can be incorporated into project reports

### About the author
My name is Nathan Whitmore, and I’m a conservation scientist and practitioner. Over the years I have worked variously as a fisheries observer, conservation ranger, and, from 2012 to 2018, as an in-country adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Papua New Guinea programme. I am currently based in New Zealand where I work for [Reproducible](reproducible.co.nz) as a conservation analyst.
